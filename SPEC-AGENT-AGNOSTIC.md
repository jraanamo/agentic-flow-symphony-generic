# Symphony Service Specification (Agent-Agnostic)

Status: Draft v2 (agent-agnostic, language-agnostic)

Purpose: Define a service that orchestrates coding agents to get project work done, without binding
to any specific agent runtime or LLM provider.

## 1. Problem Statement

Symphony is a long-running automation service that continuously reads work from an issue tracker
(Linear in this specification version), creates an isolated workspace for each issue, and runs a
coding agent session for that issue inside the workspace.

The service solves four operational problems:

- It turns issue execution into a repeatable daemon workflow instead of manual scripts.
- It isolates agent execution in per-issue workspaces so agent commands run only inside per-issue
  workspace directories.
- It keeps the workflow policy in-repo (`WORKFLOW.md`) so teams version the agent prompt and runtime
  settings with their code.
- It provides enough observability to operate and debug multiple concurrent agent runs.

Implementations are expected to document their trust and safety posture explicitly. This
specification does not require a single approval, sandbox, or operator-confirmation policy; some
implementations may target trusted environments with a high-trust configuration, while others may
require stricter approvals or sandboxing.

Important boundary:

- Symphony is a scheduler/runner and tracker reader.
- Ticket writes (state transitions, comments, PR links) are typically performed by the coding agent
  using tools available in the workflow/runtime environment.
- A successful run may end at a workflow-defined handoff state (for example `Human Review`), not
  necessarily `Done`.

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals

### 2.1 Goals

- Poll the issue tracker on a fixed cadence and dispatch work with bounded concurrency.
- Maintain a single authoritative orchestrator state for dispatch, retries, and reconciliation.
- Create deterministic per-issue workspaces and preserve them across runs.
- Stop active runs when issue state changes make them ineligible.
- Recover from transient failures with exponential backoff.
- Load runtime behavior from a repository-owned `WORKFLOW.md` contract.
- Expose operator-visible observability (at minimum structured logs).
- Support restart recovery without requiring a persistent database.
- Support pluggable agent backends without requiring changes to orchestration logic.

### 2.2 Non-Goals

- Rich web UI or multi-tenant control plane.
- Prescribing a specific dashboard or terminal UI implementation.
- General-purpose workflow engine or distributed job scheduler.
- Built-in business logic for how to edit tickets, PRs, or comments. (That logic lives in the
  workflow prompt and agent tooling.)
- Mandating strong sandbox controls beyond what the coding agent and host OS provide.
- Mandating a single default approval, sandbox, or operator-confirmation posture for all
  implementations.
- Mandating a specific LLM provider or agent runtime.

## 3. System Overview

### 3.1 Main Components

1. `Workflow Loader`
   - Reads `WORKFLOW.md`.
   - Parses YAML front matter and prompt body.
   - Returns `{config, prompt_template}`.

2. `Config Layer`
   - Exposes typed getters for workflow config values.
   - Applies defaults and environment variable indirection.
   - Performs validation used by the orchestrator before dispatch.

3. `Issue Tracker Client`
   - Fetches candidate issues in active states.
   - Fetches current states for specific issue IDs (reconciliation).
   - Fetches terminal-state issues during startup cleanup.
   - Normalizes tracker payloads into a stable issue model.

4. `Orchestrator`
   - Owns the poll tick.
   - Owns the in-memory runtime state.
   - Decides which issues to dispatch, retry, stop, or release.
   - Tracks session metrics and retry queue state.

5. `Workspace Manager`
   - Maps issue identifiers to workspace paths.
   - Ensures per-issue workspace directories exist.
   - Runs workspace lifecycle hooks.
   - Cleans workspaces for terminal issues.

6. `Agent Runner`
   - Creates workspace.
   - Builds prompt from issue + workflow template.
   - Launches the agent backend via the configured adapter.
   - Streams agent events back to the orchestrator.

7. `Status Surface` (optional)
   - Presents human-readable runtime status (for example terminal output, dashboard, or other
     operator-facing view).

8. `Logging`
   - Emits structured runtime logs to one or more configured sinks.

### 3.2 Abstraction Levels

Symphony is easiest to port when kept in these layers:

1. `Policy Layer` (repo-defined)
   - `WORKFLOW.md` prompt body.
   - Team-specific rules for ticket handling, validation, and handoff.

2. `Configuration Layer` (typed getters)
   - Parses front matter into typed runtime settings.
   - Handles defaults, environment tokens, and path normalization.

3. `Coordination Layer` (orchestrator)
   - Polling loop, issue eligibility, concurrency, retries, reconciliation.

4. `Execution Layer` (workspace + agent backend adapter)
   - Filesystem lifecycle, workspace preparation, agent backend protocol.

5. `Integration Layer` (Linear adapter)
   - API calls and normalization for tracker data.

6. `Observability Layer` (logs + optional status surface)
   - Operator visibility into orchestrator and agent behavior.

### 3.3 External Dependencies

- Issue tracker API (Linear for `tracker.kind: linear` in this specification version).
- Local filesystem for workspaces and logs.
- Optional workspace population tooling (for example Git CLI, if used).
- Agent backend: one of
  - a subprocess that speaks the agreed stdio protocol (see Section 10), or
  - a language SDK integrated directly into the runner process.
- Host environment authentication for the issue tracker and the agent backend.

## 4. Core Domain Model

### 4.1 Entities

#### 4.1.1 Issue

Normalized issue record used by orchestration, prompt rendering, and observability output.

Fields:

- `id` (string)
  - Stable tracker-internal ID.
- `identifier` (string)
  - Human-readable ticket key (example: `ABC-123`).
- `title` (string)
- `description` (string or null)
- `priority` (integer or null)
  - Lower numbers are higher priority in dispatch sorting.

  - Tracker-provided branch metadata if available.
- `url` (string or null)
- `labels` (list of strings)

  - Each blocker ref contains:
    - `id` (string or null)
    - `identifier` (string or null)
    - `state` (string or null)
- `created_at` (timestamp or null)
- `updated_at` (timestamp or null)

#### 4.1.2 Workflow Definition

Parsed `WORKFLOW.md` payload:

- `config` (map)
  - YAML front matter root object.
- `prompt_template` (string)
  - Markdown body after front matter, trimmed.

#### 4.1.3 Service Config (Typed View)

Typed runtime values derived from `WorkflowDefinition.config` plus environment resolution.

Examples:

- poll interval

- active and terminal issue states
- concurrency limits
- agent backend executable/args/timeouts
- workspace hooks

#### 4.1.4 Workspace

Filesystem workspace assigned to one issue identifier.

Fields (logical):

- `path` (workspace path; current runtime typically uses absolute paths, but relative roots are
  possible if configured without path separators)
- `workspace_key` (sanitized issue identifier)
- `created_now` (boolean, used to gate `after_create` hook)

#### 4.1.5 Run Attempt

One execution attempt for one issue.

Fields (logical):

- `issue_id`
- `issue_identifier`
- `attempt` (integer or null, `null` for first run, `>=1` for retries/continuation)
- `workspace_path`
- `started_at`
- `status`
- `error` (optional)

#### 4.1.6 Live Session (Agent Session Metadata)

State tracked while an agent backend is running.

Fields:

- `session_id` (string, `<thread_id>-<turn_id>`)

- `identifier` (best-effort human ID for status surfaces/logs)
- `attempt` (integer, 1-based for retry queue)
- `due_at_ms` (monotonic clock timestamp)
- `timer_handle` (runtime-specific timer reference)
- `error` (string or null)

#### 4.1.8 Orchestrator Runtime State

Single authoritative in-memory state owned by the orchestrator.

  - Use the sanitized value for the workspace directory name.
- `Normalized Issue State`
  - Compare states after `lowercase`.
- `Session ID`
  - Compose from agent `thread_id` and `turn_id` as `<thread_id>-<turn_id>`.

## 5. Workflow Specification (Repository Contract)

### 5.1 File Discovery and Path Resolution

Workflow file path precedence:

1. Explicit application/runtime setting (set by CLI startup path).
2. Default: `WORKFLOW.md` in the current process working directory.

Loader behavior:

- If the file cannot be read, return `missing_workflow_file` error.
- The workflow file is expected to be repository-owned and version-controlled.

### 5.2 File Format

`WORKFLOW.md` is a Markdown file with optional YAML front matter.

Design note:

- `WORKFLOW.md` should be self-contained enough to describe and run different workflows (prompt,
  runtime settings, hooks, and tracker selection/config) without requiring out-of-band
  service-specific configuration.

Parsing rules:

- If file starts with `---`, parse lines until the next `---` as YAML front matter.
- Remaining lines become the prompt body.
- If front matter is absent, treat the entire file as prompt body and use an empty config map.
- YAML front matter must decode to a map/object; non-map YAML is an error.
- Prompt body is trimmed before use.

Returned workflow object:

- `config`: front matter root object (not nested under a `config` key).
- `prompt_template`: trimmed Markdown body.

### 5.3 Front Matter Schema

Top-level keys:

- `tracker`
- `polling`
- `workspace`
- `hooks`
- `agent`
- `agent_backend`

Unknown keys should be ignored for forward compatibility.

Note:

- The workflow front matter is extensible. Optional extensions may define additional top-level keys
  (for example `server`) without changing the core schema above.
- Extensions should document their field schema, defaults, validation rules, and whether changes
  apply dynamically or require restart.
- Common extension: `server.port` (integer) enables the optional HTTP server described in Section
  13.7.

#### 5.3.1 `tracker` (object)

Fields:

- `kind` (string)
  - Required for dispatch.
  - Current supported value: `linear`
- `endpoint` (string)
  - Default for `tracker.kind == "linear"`: `https://api.linear.app/graphql`
- `api_key` (string)
  - May be a literal token or `$VAR_NAME`.
  - Canonical environment variable for `tracker.kind == "linear"`: `LINEAR_API_KEY`.
  - If `$VAR_NAME` resolves to an empty string, treat the key as missing.
- `project_slug` (string)
  - Required for dispatch when `tracker.kind == "linear"`.
- `active_states` (list of strings)
  - Default: `Todo`, `In Progress`
- `terminal_states` (list of strings)
  - Default: `Closed`, `Cancelled`, `Canceled`, `Duplicate`, `Done`

#### 5.3.2 `polling` (object)

Fields:

- `interval_ms` (integer or string integer)
  - Default: `30000`
  - Changes should be re-applied at runtime and affect future tick scheduling without restart.

#### 5.3.3 `workspace` (object)

Fields:

- `root` (path string or `$VAR`)
  - Default: `<system-temp>/symphony_workspaces`
  - `~` and strings containing path separators are expanded.
  - Bare strings without path separators are preserved as-is (relative roots are allowed but
    discouraged).

#### 5.3.4 `hooks` (object)

Fields:

- `after_create` (multiline shell script string, optional)
  - Runs only when a workspace directory is newly created.
  - Failure aborts workspace creation.
- `before_run` (multiline shell script string, optional)
  - Runs before each agent attempt after workspace preparation and before launching the agent
    backend.
  - Failure aborts the current attempt.
- `after_run` (multiline shell script string, optional)
  - Runs after each agent attempt (success, failure, timeout, or cancellation) once the workspace
    exists.
  - Failure is logged but ignored.
- `before_remove` (multiline shell script string, optional)
  - Runs before workspace deletion if the directory exists.
  - Failure is logged but ignored; cleanup still proceeds.
- `timeout_ms` (integer, optional)
  - Default: `60000`
  - Applies to all workspace hooks.
  - Non-positive values should be treated as invalid and fall back to the default.
  - Changes should be re-applied at runtime for future hook executions.

#### 5.3.5 `agent` (object)

Fields:

- `max_concurrent_agents` (integer or string integer)
  - Default: `10`
  - Changes should be re-applied at runtime and affect subsequent dispatch decisions.
- `max_retry_backoff_ms` (integer or string integer)
  - Default: `300000` (5 minutes)
  - Changes should be re-applied at runtime and affect future retry scheduling.
- `max_concurrent_agents_by_state` (map `state_name -> positive integer`)
  - Default: empty map.
  - State keys are normalized (`lowercase`) for lookup.
  - Invalid entries (non-positive or non-numeric) are ignored.

#### 5.3.6 `agent_backend` (object)

This section configures the coding agent runtime that Symphony launches per issue. The design
deliberately separates backend selection from orchestration logic so any compatible agent can be
substituted by changing this section.

Fields:

- `kind` (string)
  - Default: `subprocess`
  - Supported values:
    - `subprocess`: launch a child process and communicate over stdio (line-delimited JSON).
    - Additional kinds are implementation-defined extensions (for example `sdk`, `http`).
- `command` (string shell command)
  - Required when `kind == "subprocess"`.
  - Default: implementation-defined (for example `claude --output-format stream-json` or any other
    compatible agent CLI).
  - The runtime launches this command via `bash -lc` in the workspace directory.
  - The launched process must speak the agreed stdio protocol described in Section 10.
- `model` (string, optional)
  - LLM model identifier to pass to the agent backend (for example `claude-opus-4-7`,
    `gpt-4o`, or a local model ID for LM Studio / Ollama).
  - How this value is forwarded is implementation-defined (for example passed as a flag to the
    subprocess command, or used when initializing an SDK client).
- `api_key` (string or `$VAR_NAME`, optional)
  - Auth token for the LLM provider, if not already present in the environment.
  - Canonical environment variable names depend on the provider (for example `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
    `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
  - If `$VAR_NAME` resolves to an empty string, treat the key as missing.
  - When omitted, authentication is expected to be present in the environment already.
- `base_url` (string, optional)
  - Provider API base URL override (for example `http://localhost:1234/v1` for LM Studio, or a
    custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint).
  - When omitted, the default provider URL for the configured backend is used.
- `execution_policy` (map, optional)
  - Default: empty map (implementation-defined defaults apply).
  - Pass-through map of backend-specific execution settings such as approval requirements,
    sandboxing mode, or tool-use restrictions. Fields are forwarded to the backend as-is.
  - Implementations should document which `execution_policy` keys they recognize.
  - Unknown keys in `execution_policy` should be ignored or forwarded transparently.
  - Implementations should document their default trust and safety posture when this map is absent
    or empty.
- `turn_timeout_ms` (integer)
  - Default: `3600000` (1 hour)
- `read_timeout_ms` (integer)
  - Default: `5000`
- `stall_timeout_ms` (integer)
  - Default: `300000` (5 minutes)
  - If `<= 0`, stall detection is disabled.

Note on backend compatibility: To inspect the schema of a specific subprocess backend, consult that
backend's documentation or run its built-in schema export command if one is available.

### 5.4 Prompt Template Contract

The Markdown body of `WORKFLOW.md` is the per-issue prompt template.

Rendering requirements:

- Use a strict template engine (Liquid-compatible semantics are sufficient).
- Unknown variables must fail rendering.
- Unknown filters must fail rendering.

Template input variables:

- `issue` (object)
  - Includes all normalized issue fields, including labels and blockers.
- `attempt` (integer or null)
  - `null`/absent on first attempt.
  - Integer on retry or continuation run.

Fallback prompt behavior:

- If the workflow prompt body is empty, the runtime may use a minimal default prompt
  (`You are working on an issue from Linear.`).
- Workflow file read/parse failures are configuration/validation errors and should not silently fall
  back to a prompt.

### 5.5 Workflow Validation and Error Surface

Error classes:

- `missing_workflow_file`
- `workflow_parse_error`
- `workflow_front_matter_not_a_map`
- `template_parse_error` (during prompt rendering)
- `template_render_error` (unknown variable/filter, invalid interpolation)

Dispatch gating behavior:

- Workflow file read/YAML errors block new dispatches until fixed.
- Template errors fail only the affected run attempt.

## 6. Configuration Specification

### 6.1 Source Precedence and Resolution Semantics

Configuration precedence:

1. Workflow file path selection (runtime setting -> cwd default).
2. YAML front matter values.
3. Environment indirection via `$VAR_NAME` inside selected YAML values.
4. Built-in defaults.

Value coercion semantics:

- Path/command fields support:
  - `~` home expansion
  - `$VAR` expansion for env-backed path values
  - Apply expansion only to values intended to be local filesystem paths; do not rewrite URIs or
    arbitrary shell command strings.

### 6.2 Dynamic Reload Semantics

Dynamic reload is required:

- The software should watch `WORKFLOW.md` for changes.
- On change, it should re-read and re-apply workflow config and prompt template without restart.
- The software should attempt to adjust live behavior to the new config (for example polling
  cadence, concurrency limits, active/terminal states, agent backend settings, workspace
  paths/hooks, and prompt content for future runs).
- Reloaded config applies to future dispatch, retry scheduling, reconciliation decisions, hook
  execution, and agent launches.
- Implementations are not required to restart in-flight agent sessions automatically when config
  changes.
- Extensions that manage their own listeners/resources (for example an HTTP server port change) may
  require restart unless the implementation explicitly supports live rebind.
- Implementations should also re-validate/reload defensively during runtime operations (for example
  before dispatch) in case filesystem watch events are missed.
- Invalid reloads should not crash the service; keep operating with the last known good effective
  configuration and emit an operator-visible error.

### 6.3 Dispatch Preflight Validation

This validation is a scheduler preflight run before attempting to dispatch new work. It validates
the workflow/config needed to poll and launch workers, not a full audit of all possible workflow
behavior.

Startup validation:

- Validate configuration before starting the scheduling loop.
- If startup validation fails, fail startup and emit an operator-visible error.

Per-tick dispatch validation:

- Re-validate before each dispatch cycle.
- If validation fails, skip dispatch for that tick, keep reconciliation active, and emit an
  operator-visible error.

Validation checks:

- Workflow file can be loaded and parsed.
- `tracker.kind` is present and supported.
- `tracker.api_key` is present after `$` resolution.
- `tracker.project_slug` is present when required by the selected tracker kind.
- `agent_backend.command` is present and non-empty when `agent_backend.kind == "subprocess"`.
- Implementations for non-subprocess backend kinds should define equivalent startup checks
  (for example: SDK client can be instantiated, HTTP endpoint is reachable).

### 6.4 Config Fields Summary (Cheat Sheet)

This section is intentionally redundant so a coding agent can implement the config layer quickly.

- `tracker.kind`: string, required, currently `linear`

- `server.port` (extension): integer, optional; enables the optional HTTP server, `0` may be used
  for ephemeral local bind, and CLI `--port` overrides it

## 7. Orchestration State Machine

The orchestrator is the only component that mutates scheduling state. All worker outcomes are
reported back to it and converted into explicit state transitions.

### 7.1 Issue Orchestration States

This is not the same as tracker states (`Todo`, `In Progress`, etc.). This is the service's internal
claim state.

1. `Unclaimed`
   - Issue is not running and has no retry scheduled.

2. `Claimed`
   - Orchestrator has reserved the issue to prevent duplicate dispatch.
   - In practice, claimed issues are either `Running` or `RetryQueued`.

3. `Running`
   - Worker task exists and the issue is tracked in `running` map.

4. `RetryQueued`
   - Worker is not running, but a retry timer exists in `retry_attempts`.

5. `Released`
   - Claim removed because issue is terminal, non-active, missing, or retry path completed without
     re-dispatch.

Important nuance:

- A successful worker exit does not mean the issue is done forever.
- The worker may continue through multiple back-to-back agent turns before it exits.
- After each normal turn completion, the worker re-checks the tracker issue state.
- If the issue is still in an active state, the worker should start another turn on the same live
  agent thread in the same workspace, up to `agent.max_turns`.
- The first turn should use the full rendered task prompt.
- Continuation turns should send only continuation guidance to the existing thread, not resend the
  original task prompt that is already present in thread history.
- Once the worker exits normally, the orchestrator still schedules a short continuation retry
  (about 1 second) so it can re-check whether the issue remains active and needs another worker
  session.

### 7.2 Run Attempt Lifecycle

A run attempt transitions through these phases:

1. `PreparingWorkspace`
2. `BuildingPrompt`
3. `LaunchingAgentBackend`
4. `InitializingSession`
5. `StreamingTurn`
6. `Finishing`
7. `Succeeded`
8. `Failed`
9. `TimedOut`
10. `Stalled`
11. `CanceledByReconciliation`

Distinct terminal reasons are important because retry logic and logs differ.

### 7.3 Transition Triggers

- `Poll Tick`
  - Reconcile active runs.
  - Validate config.
  - Fetch candidate issues.
  - Dispatch until slots are exhausted.

- `Worker Exit (normal)`
  - Remove running entry.
  - Update aggregate runtime totals.
  - Schedule continuation retry (attempt `1`) after the worker exhausts or finishes its in-process
    turn loop.

- `Worker Exit (abnormal)`
  - Remove running entry.
  - Update aggregate runtime totals.
  - Schedule exponential-backoff retry.

- `Agent Update Event`
  - Update live session fields, token counters, and rate limits.

- `Retry Timer Fired`
  - Re-fetch active candidates and attempt re-dispatch, or release claim if no longer eligible.

- `Reconciliation State Refresh`
  - Stop runs whose issue states are terminal or no longer active.

- `Stall Timeout`
  - Kill worker and schedule retry.

### 7.4 Idempotency and Recovery Rules

- The orchestrator serializes state mutations through one authority to avoid duplicate dispatch.
- `claimed` and `running` checks are required before launching any worker.
- Reconciliation runs before dispatch on every tick.
- Restart recovery is tracker-driven and filesystem-driven (no durable orchestrator DB required).
- Startup terminal cleanup removes stale workspaces for issues already in terminal states.

## 8. Polling, Scheduling, and Reconciliation

### 8.1 Poll Loop

At startup, the service validates config, performs startup cleanup, schedules an immediate tick, and
then repeats every `polling.interval_ms`.

The effective poll interval should be updated when workflow config changes are re-applied.

Tick sequence:

1. Reconcile running issues.
2. Run dispatch preflight validation.
3. Fetch candidate issues from tracker using active states.
4. Sort issues by dispatch priority.
5. Dispatch eligible issues while slots remain.
6. Notify observability/status consumers of state changes.

If per-tick validation fails, dispatch is skipped for that tick, but reconciliation still happens
first.

### 8.2 Candidate Selection Rules

An issue is dispatch-eligible only if all are true:

- It has `id`, `identifier`, `title`, and `state`.
- Its state is in `active_states` and not in `terminal_states`.
- It is not already in `running`.
- It is not already in `claimed`.
- Global concurrency slots are available.
- Per-state concurrency slots are available.
- Blocker rule for `Todo` state passes:
  - If the issue state is `Todo`, do not dispatch when any blocker is non-terminal.

Sorting order (stable intent):

1. `priority` ascending (1..4 are preferred; null/unknown sorts last)
2. `created_at` oldest first
3. `identifier` lexicographic tie-breaker

### 8.3 Concurrency Control

Global limit:

- `available_slots = max(max_concurrent_agents - running_count, 0)`

Per-state limit:

- `max_concurrent_agents_by_state[state]` if present (state key normalized)
- otherwise fallback to global limit

The runtime counts issues by their current tracked state in the `running` map.

Optional SSH host limit:

- When `worker.max_concurrent_agents_per_host` is set, each configured SSH host may run at most
  that many concurrent agents at once.
- Hosts at that cap are skipped for new dispatch until capacity frees up.

### 8.4 Retry and Backoff

Retry entry creation:

- Cancel any existing retry timer for the same issue.
- Store `attempt`, `identifier`, `error`, `due_at_ms`, and new timer handle.

Backoff formula:

- Normal continuation retries after a clean worker exit use a short fixed delay of `1000` ms.
- Failure-driven retries use `delay = min(10000 * 2^(attempt - 1), agent.max_retry_backoff_ms)`.
- Power is capped by the configured max retry backoff (default `300000` / 5m).

Retry handling behavior:

1. Fetch active candidate issues (not all issues).
2. Find the specific issue by `issue_id`.
3. If not found, release claim.
4. If found and still candidate-eligible:
   - Dispatch if slots are available.
   - Otherwise requeue with error `no available orchestrator slots`.
5. If found but no longer active, release claim.

Note:

- Terminal-state workspace cleanup is handled by startup cleanup and active-run reconciliation
  (including terminal transitions for currently running issues).
- Retry handling mainly operates on active candidates and releases claims when the issue is absent,
  rather than performing terminal cleanup itself.

### 8.5 Active Run Reconciliation

Reconciliation runs every tick and has two parts.

Part A: Stall detection

- For each running issue, compute `elapsed_ms` since:
  - `last_agent_timestamp` if any event has been seen, else
  - `started_at`
- If `elapsed_ms > agent_backend.stall_timeout_ms`, terminate the worker and queue a retry.
- If `stall_timeout_ms <= 0`, skip stall detection entirely.

Part B: Tracker state refresh

- Fetch current issue states for all running issue IDs.
- For each running issue:
  - If tracker state is terminal: terminate worker and clean workspace.
  - If tracker state is still active: update the in-memory issue snapshot.
  - If tracker state is neither active nor terminal: terminate worker without workspace cleanup.
- If state refresh fails, keep workers running and try again on the next tick.

### 8.6 Startup Terminal Workspace Cleanup

When the service starts:

1. Query tracker for issues in terminal states.
2. For each returned issue identifier, remove the corresponding workspace directory.
3. If the terminal-issues fetch fails, log a warning and continue startup.

This prevents stale terminal workspaces from accumulating after restarts.

## 9. Workspace Management and Safety

### 9.1 Workspace Layout

Workspace root:

- `workspace.root` (normalized path; the current config layer expands path-like values and preserves
  bare relative names)

Per-issue workspace path:

- `<workspace.root>/<sanitized_issue_identifier>`

Workspace persistence:

- Workspaces are reused across runs for the same issue.
- Successful runs do not auto-delete workspaces.

### 9.2 Workspace Creation and Reuse

Input: `issue.identifier`

Algorithm summary:

1. Sanitize identifier to `workspace_key`.
2. Compute workspace path under workspace root.
3. Ensure the workspace path exists as a directory.
4. Mark `created_now=true` only if the directory was created during this call; otherwise
   `created_now=false`.
5. If `created_now=true`, run `after_create` hook if configured.

Notes:

- This section does not assume any specific repository/VCS workflow.
- Workspace preparation beyond directory creation (for example dependency bootstrap, checkout/sync,
  code generation) is implementation-defined and is typically handled via hooks.

### 9.3 Optional Workspace Population (Implementation-Defined)

The spec does not require any built-in VCS or repository bootstrap behavior.

Implementations may populate or synchronize the workspace using implementation-defined logic and/or
hooks (for example `after_create` and/or `before_run`).

Failure handling:

- Workspace population/synchronization failures return an error for the current attempt.
- If failure happens while creating a brand-new workspace, implementations may remove the partially
  prepared directory.
- Reused workspaces should not be destructively reset on population failure unless that policy is
  explicitly chosen and documented.

### 9.4 Workspace Hooks

Supported hooks:

- `hooks.after_create`
- `hooks.before_run`
- `hooks.after_run`
- `hooks.before_remove`

Execution contract:

- Execute in a local shell context appropriate to the host OS, with the workspace directory as
  `cwd`.
- On POSIX systems, `sh -lc <script>` (or a stricter equivalent such as `bash -lc <script>`) is a
  conforming default.
- Hook timeout uses `hooks.timeout_ms`; default: `60000 ms`.
- Log hook start, failures, and timeouts.

Failure semantics:

- `after_create` failure or timeout is fatal to workspace creation.
- `before_run` failure or timeout is fatal to the current run attempt.
- `after_run` failure or timeout is logged and ignored.
- `before_remove` failure or timeout is logged and ignored.

### 9.5 Safety Invariants

This is the most important portability constraint.

Invariant 1: Run the coding agent only in the per-issue workspace path.

- Before launching the agent backend, validate:
  - `cwd == workspace_path`

Invariant 2: Workspace path must stay inside workspace root.

- Normalize both paths to absolute.
- Require `workspace_path` to have `workspace_root` as a prefix directory.
- Reject any path outside the workspace root.

Invariant 3: Workspace key is sanitized.

- Only `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` allowed in workspace directory names.
- Replace all other characters with `_`.

## 10. Agent Runner Protocol (Agent Backend Integration)

This section defines the language-neutral contract for integrating a coding agent backend. The
spec intentionally avoids mandating a single wire format; instead it defines an abstract interface
with two reference implementation patterns.

### 10.1 Abstract Agent Backend Interface

All agent backend adapters expose the same logical interface to the orchestrator:

1. `start_session(workspace_path, config, tools)` → `session_handle`
   - Initialize the agent, establish a conversation thread, and return an opaque handle.
   - `tools` is an optional list of client-side tool descriptors to advertise to the backend.

2. `run_turn(session_handle, prompt, metadata)` → `stream<AgentEvent>`
   - Send a prompt (or continuation guidance) to the agent and return a stream of events.
   - `metadata` carries context such as issue identifier and title.
   - The first turn uses the full rendered task prompt.
   - Continuation turns on the same thread send only continuation guidance.

3. `stop_session(session_handle)`
   - Terminate the agent backend (graceful if possible, then forced).

4. `handle_tool_call(session_handle, tool_call_id, name, args)` → `tool_result`
   - Called when the backend requests a client-side tool execution (for example `linear_graphql`).
   - Unsupported tool names should return a failure result rather than stalling.

Implementations are free to realize this interface as:

- A **subprocess adapter** (Section 10.2): spawn a child process and communicate over stdio.
- An **SDK adapter**: call an agent SDK directly in-process (for example Anthropic Python SDK,
  OpenAI SDK, or a local model via LM Studio's OpenAI-compatible endpoint).
- An **HTTP adapter** (implementation-defined extension): call a running agent HTTP service.

### 10.2 Subprocess Adapter Reference Pattern

This pattern launches an agent CLI or server as a child process and communicates via line-delimited
JSON messages on stdio. It is compatible with Codex app-server, Claude Code
(`claude --output-format stream-json`), and any other agent that speaks a similar stdio protocol.

Launch parameters:

- Command: `agent_backend.command`
- Invocation: `bash -lc <agent_backend.command>`
- Working directory: workspace path
- Stdout/stderr: separate streams
- Framing: line-delimited JSON messages on stdout

Recommended additional process settings:

- Max line size: 10 MB (for safe buffering)

Startup handshake (illustrative; exact message shapes depend on the chosen subprocess):

The subprocess adapter should perform whatever initialization handshake the target subprocess
requires. Common patterns include:

- A capability negotiation exchange (for example `initialize` / `initialized`).
- A thread or session creation request that returns a thread identifier.
- A turn start request that carries the prompt and returns a turn identifier.

Session identifiers:

- Capture a stable `thread_id` from the session-creation response.
- Capture a `turn_id` from each turn-start response.
- Emit `session_id = "<thread_id>-<turn_id>"`.
- Reuse the same `thread_id` for all continuation turns inside one worker run.

Line handling requirements:

- Read protocol messages from stdout only.
- Buffer partial stdout lines until newline arrives.
- Attempt JSON parse on complete stdout lines.
- Stderr is not part of the protocol stream:
  - ignore it or log it as diagnostics
  - do not attempt protocol JSON parsing on stderr

### 10.3 SDK Adapter Reference Pattern

An SDK adapter calls a language SDK in-process and maps its responses to the normalized
`AgentEvent` stream described in Section 10.4.

For example, an Anthropic SDK adapter would:

1. Instantiate an `Anthropic` client (with optional `api_key` and `base_url` overrides from
   `agent_backend` config).
2. Maintain a messages array as the "thread" across turns.
3. Call `client.messages.create(...)` with streaming enabled for each turn.
4. Translate streaming delta events into normalized `AgentEvent` values.

For a local LM Studio or Ollama backend:

1. Use an OpenAI-compatible client pointed at `agent_backend.base_url`.
2. Proceed identically to the Anthropic SDK pattern, using the model ID from
   `agent_backend.model`.

### 10.4 Normalized AgentEvent Stream

All adapter types emit the same normalized event stream to the orchestrator. Each event should
include:

- `event` (enum/string, see below)
- `timestamp` (UTC timestamp)
- `agent_pid` (if a subprocess, process ID; otherwise null)
- optional `usage` map (token counts)
- payload fields as needed

Event types:

- `session_started`
- `startup_failed`
- `turn_completed`
- `turn_failed`
- `turn_cancelled`
- `turn_ended_with_error`
- `turn_input_required`
- `approval_required`
- `tool_call` (agent requested a client-side tool invocation)
- `agent_message` (agent produced a text or structured message)
- `usage_update` (token/rate-limit telemetry)
- `other_message`
- `malformed`

### 10.5 Execution Policy, Tool Calls, and User Input

Approval, sandbox, and user-input behavior is implementation-defined and should be expressed via
`agent_backend.execution_policy`.

Policy requirements:

- Each implementation should document its chosen approval, sandbox, and operator-confirmation
  posture.
- Approval requests and user-input-required events must not leave a run stalled indefinitely. An
  implementation should either satisfy them, surface them to an operator, auto-resolve them, or
  fail the run according to its documented policy.

Example high-trust behavior:

- Auto-approve command execution approvals for the session.
- Auto-approve file-change approvals for the session.
- Treat user-input-required turns as hard failure.

Unsupported client-side tool calls:

- If the agent requests a tool that is not supported, return a tool failure response and continue
  the session.
- This prevents the session from stalling on unsupported execution paths.

Optional client-side tool extension:

- An implementation may expose a limited set of client-side tools to the agent backend session.
- Current optional standardized tool: `linear_graphql`.
- Supported tools should be advertised to the backend session during startup using whatever
  mechanism the target adapter supports.
- Unsupported tool names should still return a failure result and continue the session.

`linear_graphql` extension contract:

- Purpose: execute a raw GraphQL query or mutation against Linear using Symphony's configured
  tracker auth for the current session.
- Availability: only meaningful when `tracker.kind == "linear"` and valid Linear auth is configured.
- Preferred input shape:

  ```json
  {
    "query": "single GraphQL query or mutation document",
    "variables": {
      "optional": "graphql variables object"
    }
  }
  ```

- `query` must be a non-empty string.
- `query` must contain exactly one GraphQL operation.
- `variables` is optional and, when present, must be a JSON object.
- Implementations may additionally accept a raw GraphQL query string as shorthand input.
- Execute one GraphQL operation per tool call.
- If the provided document contains multiple operations, reject the tool call as invalid input.
- `operationName` selection is intentionally out of scope for this extension.
- Reuse the configured Linear endpoint and auth from the active Symphony workflow/runtime config; do
  not require the coding agent to read raw tokens from disk.
- Tool result semantics:
  - transport success + no top-level GraphQL `errors` -> `success=true`
  - top-level GraphQL `errors` present -> `success=false`, but preserve the GraphQL response body
    for debugging
  - invalid input, missing auth, or transport failure -> `success=false` with an error payload
- Return the GraphQL response or error payload as structured tool output that the model can inspect
  in-session.

Hard failure on user input requirement:

- If the agent requires interactive user input, fail the run attempt immediately.

### 10.6 Timeouts and Error Mapping

Timeouts:

- `agent_backend.read_timeout_ms`: request/response timeout during startup and sync requests
- `agent_backend.turn_timeout_ms`: total turn stream timeout
- `agent_backend.stall_timeout_ms`: enforced by orchestrator based on event inactivity

Error mapping (recommended normalized categories):

- `agent_not_found` (subprocess executable not found or SDK not installed)
- `invalid_workspace_cwd`
- `response_timeout`
- `turn_timeout`
- `process_exit`
- `response_error`
- `turn_failed`
- `turn_cancelled`
- `turn_input_required`

### 10.7 Agent Runner Contract

The `Agent Runner` wraps workspace + prompt + agent backend adapter.

Behavior:

1. Create/reuse workspace for issue.
2. Build prompt from workflow template.
3. Start agent backend session.
4. Forward agent events to orchestrator.
5. On any error, fail the worker attempt (the orchestrator will retry).

Note:

- Workspaces are intentionally preserved after successful runs.

### 10.8 Adding a New Agent Backend

To integrate a new agent (for example a new open-source CLI or a new LLM provider SDK):

1. Implement the abstract interface in Section 10.1.
2. Map the new backend's event types to the normalized `AgentEvent` stream (Section 10.4).
3. Document the supported `agent_backend.execution_policy` keys and defaults.
4. Set `agent_backend.kind` to the new adapter name in `WORKFLOW.md` front matter.

No changes to the orchestrator, workspace manager, or tracker client are required.

## 11. Issue Tracker Integration Contract (Linear-Compatible)

### 11.1 Required Operations

An implementation must support these tracker adapter operations:

1. `fetch_candidate_issues()`
   - Return issues in configured active states for a configured project.

2. `fetch_issues_by_states(state_names)`
   - Used for startup terminal cleanup.

3. `fetch_issue_states_by_ids(issue_ids)`
   - Used for active-run reconciliation.

### 11.2 Query Semantics (Linear)

Linear-specific requirements for `tracker.kind == "linear"`:

- `tracker.kind == "linear"`
- GraphQL endpoint (default `https://api.linear.app/graphql`)
- Auth token sent in `Authorization` header
- `tracker.project_slug` maps to Linear project `slugId`
- Candidate issue query filters project using `project: { slugId: { eq: $projectSlug } }`
- Issue-state refresh query uses GraphQL issue IDs with variable type `[ID!]`
- Pagination required for candidate issues
- Page size default: `50`
- Network timeout: `30000 ms`

Important:

- Linear GraphQL schema details can drift. Keep query construction isolated and test the exact query
  fields/types required by this specification.

A non-Linear implementation may change transport details, but the normalized outputs must match the
domain model in Section 4.

### 11.3 Normalization Rules

Candidate issue normalization should produce fields listed in Section 4.1.1.

Additional normalization details:

- `labels` -> lowercase strings
- `blocked_by` -> derived from inverse relations where relation type is `blocks`
- `priority` -> integer only (non-integers become null)
- `created_at` and `updated_at` -> parse ISO-8601 timestamps

### 11.4 Error Handling Contract

Recommended error categories:

- `unsupported_tracker_kind`
- `missing_tracker_api_key`
- `missing_tracker_project_slug`
- `linear_api_request` (transport failures)
- `linear_api_status` (non-200 HTTP)
- `linear_graphql_errors`
- `linear_unknown_payload`
- `linear_missing_end_cursor` (pagination integrity error)

Orchestrator behavior on tracker errors:

- Candidate fetch failure: log and skip dispatch for this tick.
- Running-state refresh failure: log and keep active workers running.
- Startup terminal cleanup failure: log warning and continue startup.

### 11.5 Tracker Writes (Important Boundary)

Symphony does not require first-class tracker write APIs in the orchestrator.

- Ticket mutations (state transitions, comments, PR metadata) are typically handled by the coding
  agent using tools defined by the workflow prompt.
- The service remains a scheduler/runner and tracker reader.
- Workflow-specific success often means "reached the next handoff state" (for example
  `Human Review`) rather than tracker terminal state `Done`.
- If the optional `linear_graphql` client-side tool extension is implemented, it is still part of
  the agent toolchain rather than orchestrator business logic.

## 12. Prompt Construction and Context Assembly

### 12.1 Inputs

Inputs to prompt rendering:

- `workflow.prompt_template`
- normalized `issue` object
- optional `attempt` integer (retry/continuation metadata)

### 12.2 Rendering Rules

- Render with strict variable checking.
- Render with strict filter checking.
- Convert issue object keys to strings for template compatibility.
- Preserve nested arrays/maps (labels, blockers) so templates can iterate.

### 12.3 Retry/Continuation Semantics

`attempt` should be passed to the template because the workflow prompt may provide different
instructions for:

- first run (`attempt` null or absent)
- continuation run after a successful prior session
- retry after error/timeout/stall

### 12.4 Failure Semantics

If prompt rendering fails:

- Fail the run attempt immediately.
- Let the orchestrator treat it like any other worker failure and decide retry behavior.

## 13. Logging, Status, and Observability

### 13.1 Logging Conventions

Required context fields for issue-related logs:

- `issue_id`
- `issue_identifier`

Required context for agent session lifecycle logs:

- `session_id`

Message formatting requirements:

- Use stable `key=value` phrasing.
- Include action outcome (`completed`, `failed`, `retrying`, etc.).
- Include concise failure reason when present.
- Avoid logging large raw payloads unless necessary.

### 13.2 Logging Outputs and Sinks

The spec does not prescribe where logs must go (stderr, file, remote sink, etc.).

Requirements:

- Operators must be able to see startup/validation/dispatch failures without attaching a debugger.
- Implementations may write to one or more sinks.
- If a configured log sink fails, the service should continue running when possible and emit an
  operator-visible warning through any remaining sink.

### 13.3 Runtime Snapshot / Monitoring Interface (Optional but Recommended)

If the implementation exposes a synchronous runtime snapshot (for dashboards or monitoring), it
should return:

- `running` (list of running session rows)
- each running row should include `turn_count`
- `retrying` (list of retry queue rows)
- `agent_totals`
  - `input_tokens`
  - `output_tokens`
  - `total_tokens`
  - `seconds_running` (aggregate runtime seconds as of snapshot time, including active sessions)
- `rate_limits` (latest agent rate limit payload, if available; format is backend-defined)

Recommended snapshot error modes:

- `timeout`
- `unavailable`

### 13.4 Optional Human-Readable Status Surface

A human-readable status surface (terminal output, dashboard, etc.) is optional and
implementation-defined.

If present, it should draw from orchestrator state/metrics only and must not be required for
correctness.

### 13.5 Session Metrics and Token Accounting

Token accounting rules:

- Agent events may include token counts in multiple payload shapes depending on the backend.
- Prefer absolute thread totals when available over per-delta/per-message token counts.
- Extract input/output/total token counts leniently from common field names within the selected
  payload.
- For absolute totals, track deltas relative to last reported totals to avoid double-counting.
- Do not treat generic `usage` maps as cumulative totals unless the event type defines them that
  way.
- Accumulate aggregate totals in orchestrator state under `agent_totals`.

Runtime accounting:

- Runtime should be reported as a live aggregate at snapshot/render time.
- Implementations may maintain a cumulative counter for ended sessions and add active-session
  elapsed time derived from `running` entries (for example `started_at`) when producing a
  snapshot/status view.
- Add run duration seconds to the cumulative ended-session runtime when a session ends (normal exit
  or cancellation/termination).
- Continuous background ticking of runtime totals is not required.

Rate-limit tracking:

- Track the latest rate-limit payload seen in any agent update.
- Format of rate-limit data is backend-defined and should be forwarded as-is to the status surface.
- Any human-readable presentation of rate-limit data is implementation-defined.

### 13.6 Humanized Agent Event Summaries (Optional)

Humanized summaries of raw agent events are optional.

If implemented:

- Treat them as observability-only output.
- Do not make orchestrator logic depend on humanized strings.

## Appendix A: WORKFLOW.md Front Matter Migration Guide

When migrating a `WORKFLOW.md` from a Codex-bound deployment to an agent-agnostic one, apply the
following changes to the front matter:

1. Rename the `codex:` block to `agent_backend:`.
2. Replace the Codex-specific `command` with the command for the chosen backend. Examples:
   - Claude Code subprocess: `claude --output-format stream-json --max-turns 20`
   - Custom agent wrapper: `python my_agent.py --model claude-opus-4-7`
3. Replace `approval_policy`, `thread_sandbox`, and `turn_sandbox_policy` with an
   `execution_policy:` map containing backend-specific keys, or remove them and rely on
   implementation defaults.
4. Add `model:` and/or `api_key:` / `base_url:` fields if the backend requires them.
5. In the prompt body, rename any references to `## Codex Workpad` to `## Agent Workpad` (or any
   team-preferred marker) for clarity.

Example before (Codex-bound):

```yaml
codex:
  command: codex --config shell_environment_policy.inherit=all app-server
  approval_policy: never
  thread_sandbox: workspace-write
  turn_sandbox_policy:
    type: workspaceWrite
```

Example after (agent-agnostic, Claude Code subprocess):

```yaml
agent_backend:
  kind: subprocess
  command: claude --output-format stream-json
  model: claude-opus-4-7
  api_key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
  execution_policy:
    approval: never
```

Example after (agent-agnostic, LM Studio local model):

```yaml
agent_backend:
  kind: subprocess
  command: python my_openai_agent.py
  model: lmstudio-community/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct-GGUF
  base_url: http://localhost:1234/v1
  execution_policy: {}
```
